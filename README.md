# HeirToTheThrone

This is a simple adventure game I built using vanilla HTML/CSS and Javascript. It's loosely based on the game Mafia and is played by clicking on different in-game locations to search for clues as well as to avoid the imposters who are out to kill you.

## Setup

- Git clone this repo
- Open adventure_homepage.html in the ``` adventure/ ``` folder
- Follow the instructions and play the game!
